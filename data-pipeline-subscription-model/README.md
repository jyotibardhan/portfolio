# Data Pipeline for subscription plans and subscribed members analysis

This project aimed to create a big data pipeline using AWS Lambda, AWS Glue, AWS S3, Amazon Redshift, Amazon EventBridge, and Amazon Quicksight to conduct intricate analysis on a dataset of subscription plans and subscribed members for a provider(confidential). The goal was to develop an interactive dashboard that can provide insights into the trends and patterns of the subscription plans, allowing for more informed decision-making.
