# Data Engineering Portfolio Jyotirmoy Bardhan

This Repo contains script snippets from my data engineering and data scientist projects I have completed so far. Since the whole code for any LIVE project is not possible to share in public repos, I am sharing codes to showcase my programming pattern and standard to my prospective employers/companies. Anyone can use the code freely without any credits[would appreciate it though :)] but without any guarantee or liability from my side.

Thank you
